Thank you for working with us to develop an [action plan](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/business/business-support/business-in-your-sector/key-industries/creative-and-digital/tech-startups) that will support the growth of Sydney’s tech startup ecosystem.

The plan outlines how the City of Sydney can create an environment that enables technology entrepreneurs to start and grow successful global businesses . 

A draft plan was on [public exhibition](http://sydneyyoursay.com.au/tech-startups-action-plan) from 18 August to 11 November 2015.

In total, 344 people gave us feedback via an online survey and 20 participated in an online discussion forum while 31 organisations or individuals emailed submissions.

The range of participants included tech startup entrepreneurs, employees and supporters, professionals in corporate businesses, investors, educators and students.

This is a snapshot of what the tech startup community told us in the online survey.

We considered these results and [all feedback we received](http://sydneyyoursay.com.au/tech-startups-action-plan) when we finalised the plan.

You can read a report about the feedback we received, our response and the final action plan on [Sydney Your Say](http://sydneyyoursay.com.au/tech-startups-action-plan).

Council adopted the action plan at its meeting on 27 June 2016. We look forward to working with you to start it. [Here are some of the projects underway.](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/business/business-support/business-in-your-sector/key-industries/creative-and-digital/technology-start-ups)
